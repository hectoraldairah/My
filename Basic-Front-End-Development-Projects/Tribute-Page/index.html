      <h1>Who is Richard?<h1>
        <p>> Richard is the Founder of Pied Piper, and it was his choice to split amicably from PiperChat. He was not fired</p>
        <p>> While Richard gives PiperChat his blessing and a license to his compression algorithm — an algorithm some have called a game- changing technology worth seeing through to its greatest potential to impact the world — he is now focusing on a new project. He can’t go into specifics at this time, but let’s just say it’s going to be pretty big, and not crazy.</p>
        <p>Richard first moved to Silicon Valley to study computer science at Stanford. He left four credits shy of graduation to concentrate on his true passion: compressing data. He created Pied Piper to pursue that passion and bring his middle-out algorithm to all. He and his team launched the Pied Piper platform earlier this year, which didn’t quite catch on with the public, but that was no reflection on the tech. The tech remains revolutionary.</p>
